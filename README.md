# YAP - Yet Another Planner (backend)

---------------------------------------

This is a part of our IT school project. We have to choose, plan and execute our own idea. 
We chose to (attempt to) make a (simple) group planner where one can create a group and assign tasks

---------------------------------------

This is the backend of YAP, and it features:

- Interfacing with the database
- Authentication
- REST API
