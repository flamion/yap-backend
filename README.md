# YAP - Yet Another Planner (backend)

---------------------------------------

This is a part of our IT school project.
We have to choose, plan and execute our own idea.
We chose to (attempt to) make a (simple) group planner where one can create a group and assign tasks

---------------------------------------

This is the backend of YAP and it features: 
  - interfacing with a database
  - authentification
  - REST API
